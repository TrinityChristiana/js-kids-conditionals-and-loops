# Awesome Animals

Preview at: 

This challange is from the book *Javascript for Kids: A playful introduction to programming by Nick Morgan*
***

Write a `for` loop that modifies an array of animals, making them awesome! For example, if your starting array is:

```js
var animals = ["Cat", "Fish", "Lemur", "Komodo Dragon"];
```

then after you run your loop it should look like this:

```js
["Awesome Cat", "Awesome Fish", "Awesome Lemur", "Awesome Komodo Dragon"]
```

Hint: You'll need to *reassign* values in the array at each index. This just means assigning a new value at an existing position in the array. For example, to make the first animal awesome, you could say: 

```js
animals[0] = "Awesome " + animals[0];
```
